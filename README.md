# Uncommon Hack Code Errors

This repository demonstrates a couple of less common errors that can occur in Hack code. These errors involve:

1. **Missing Return Statement:** A function without a return statement in all execution paths.
2. **Incomplete if-else Statement:** An if-else statement that doesn't account for all possible conditions.

The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.hack` file provides corrected versions.

The errors, while subtle, can lead to unexpected behavior, runtime errors, or compilation failures depending on the Hack compiler's strictness.
